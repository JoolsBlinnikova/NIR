# Development of a methodology for automated detection of anomalies in the behavior of applications based on network traffic

This work discusses the development of a methodology for automated anomaly detection. The system allows to find anomalies in the behavior of applications based on network traffic This solution consists of components that are responsible for collecting, organizing, and partitioning incoming data, for processing and analyzing data, for storing, and the solution is designed for visual analysis of data. The resulting system is scalable and easily deployable.
